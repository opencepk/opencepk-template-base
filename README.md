# Getting Started


## Getting Started - Prerequisites


## Getting Started - Installation

<!--
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things,
such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However,
consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and
would like more guidance.

Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to
using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context
like a particular programming language version or operating system or
has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.
-->

## Getting Started - Usage

<!--
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can.
It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate,
while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably
include in the README.
-->

## Contributing

<!--
State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.
For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation
on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables
that they need to set. Make these steps explicit.
These instructions could also be useful to your future self.
You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests.
These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes
inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful
if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.
